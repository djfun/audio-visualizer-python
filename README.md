# Audio Visualizer Python

**We need a good name that is not as generic as "audio-visualizer-python"!**

This is a little GUI tool which creates an audio visualization video from an input audio file. Different components can be added and layered to change the resulting video and add images, videos, gradients, text, etc. Encoding options can be changed with a variety of different output containers.

The program works on **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**. If you encounter problems running it or have other bug reports or features that you wish to see implemented, please fork the project and submit a pull request and/or file an [issue](https://github.com/djfun/audio-visualizer-python/issues) on this project.

## Installation on Linux

### System dependencies

- Install FFmpeg:
    - On Ubuntu: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
    - On Arch: `sudo pacman -S ffmpeg`

### Using pipx

- **This is a good method if you just want to use the program**
- Install `pipx` tool if you don't have it:
    - On Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python-pipx`
    - On Arch: `sudo pacman -S python-pipx`
- Install this program: `pipx install git+https://github.com/djfun/audio-visualizer-python`
- Run this program with `avp` or `python -m avp` from terminal

### Using a Python virtual environment

- **This is a good method if you want to edit the code**
- Make a virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
- Activate it: `source env/bin/activate`
- Install uv: `pip install uv`
- Install this program by running `uv sync` in this directory
- Run program with `avp` or `python -m avp` or `uv run avp`
- Optional: Tests can be run with `uv run pytest`

## Installation on Windows

- Install Python from the Windows Store
- Add Python to your system PATH (it should ask during the installation process)
- Download this repo (extract from zip if needed)
- Download and install [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html). Use the GPL-licensed static builds.
- Add FFmpeg to the system PATH as well (program will then work anywhere)
    - Alternatively, copy ffmpeg.exe into the folder that you want to run the program within
- Open command prompt, `cd` into the repo directory, and run: `pip install .`
- Now run `avp` or `python -m avp` from a command prompt window to start the app

## Installation on macOS

- We need help writing instructions for macOS, but the program should work in theory.

## Using commandline interface

Projects can be created with the GUI then loaded from the commandline for easy automation of video production. Some components have commandline options for extra customization, and you can save "presets" with settings to load if the commandline option doesn't exist.

### Example command

- Create a video with a grey "classic visualizer", background image, and text:
    - `avp -c 0 image path=src/tests/data/test.jpg -c 1 classic color=180,180,180 -c 2 text "title=Episode 371" -i src/tests/data/test.ogg -o output.mp4`
- [See more about commandline mode in the wiki!](https://github.com/djfun/audio-visualizer-python/wiki/Commandline-Mode)

## Developer Information

### Dependencies

- Python 3.13
- FFmpeg 4.4.1 - 8.0.1
- PyQt6 v6.10.2 (Qt v6.10.1)
- Pillow 12.1.0
- NumPy 2.4.1

### Getting Faster Export Times

- [Pillow-SIMD](https://github.com/uploadcare/pillow-simd) may be used as a drop-in replacement for Pillow if you desire faster video export times, but it must be compiled from source. For help installing dependencies to compile Pillow-SIMD, see the [Pillow installation guide](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/building-from-source.html).

### Developing a New Component

- Information for developing a component is in our wiki: [How a Component Works](https://github.com/djfun/audio-visualizer-python/wiki/How-a-Component-Works)
- File an issue on GitHub if you need help fitting your visualizer into our component system; we would be happy to collaborate
